I saw a really cool visualization at a Disclosure concert I went to last weekend and I'm trying to shamelessly clone it.

Run:

```
npm install
typings install
npm run run
```

Todos:

- [x] Pause interpolation on end states for a moment
- [ ] Transition animations should be staggered from back to front
- Transitions
  - [ ] Rectangle <-> square transition (collapse sides in)
  - [ ] Square <-> triangle transition (collapse top two points into midpoint)
  - [ ] Hexagon? <-> Bowtie animation (opposite points should collapse in past rectangle)
  - Create cool bonus transitions by allowing interp > 1
    - [ ] "Flower" (hexagon -> circle)
    - [ ] Hexagon -> Rectangle: https://gfycat.com/NextWildDogfish
