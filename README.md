I saw a really cool visualization at a Disclosure concert I went to last weekend and I'm trying to shamelessly clone it.

Run:

```
npm install
typings install
npm run run
```

Todos:

- [ ] Pause interpolation on end states for a moment
- [ ] Rectangle <-> square transition (collapse sides in)
- [ ] Square <-> triangle transition (collapse top two points into midpoint)
- [ ] Transition animations should be staggered from back to front
- [ ] Hexagon? <-> Bowtie animation (opposite points should collapse in past rectangle)
